Hi. My name is Arthur. I go by `faso` online. I write software for a living and I think a lot about programming, computation and how we interface with technology.

You can find a link to my GitHub at the very bottom of page. I put some of the things I'm working on there.

Check out a quick intro about this blog in the [first post](https://faso.dev/posts/intro/).
