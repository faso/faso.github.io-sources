## Hello World
Hi. My name is Arthur. I go by `faso` online. I write software for a living and I think a lot about programming, computation and how we interface with technology.

You can find a link to my GitHub at the very bottom of page. I put some of the things I'm working on there.

## Mission statement
I intend to use this blog as a place to report my thoughts and research in things I mentioned a couple sentences ago. I don't intend to write often,
because I want the posts to be quite polished and well-researched. We'll see if that holds.

The goal is to encourage more radical and independent thinking in people working in adjacent fields. I feel that often outside of academia there's a lack of focus on innovation that's not product-related. Not to say there isn't any at all, I just want there to be more. So if I can spark at least just some discussion in this direction, I'll take that as a win.
